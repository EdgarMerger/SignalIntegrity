PySIApp and SignalIntegrity Toolbox are Python based tools for solving four basic signal integrity problems. (See the <a class="Reference" href="PySIHelp-Section-4.html#sec:Introduction">Introduction↓</a> for what these problems are).
</div>
<div class="Standard">
The SignalIntegrity Toolbox is a Python package that is essentially a library of functions that can be used to solve these problems through Python scripts that you create.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
PySIApp is a TkInter based Python GUI application that relies on the SignalIntegrity Toolbox which allows users to solve problems in a graphical environment.

<div class="Standard">
This software is the culmination of several years of effort by Pete Pupalaikis of Teledyne LeCroy. While writing a book on signal integrity (to be released someday!), he recognized patterns in the mathematics behind s-parameters and s-parameter based systems that allow the math to be tweaked slightly to perform simulation, virtual probing, s-parameter generation and deembedding, all from the same basic mathematical concepts. The purpose and underlying principal of the book and theory is that:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
engineers rely too heavily on tools that they don’t understand, and it is not only within their grasp to understand the theory, it is really imperative to understand the results.
</li>
<li>
once you understand the theory, you can do many things yourself and gain the benefit of releasing yourself from reliance on expensive, black-box tools that you don’t understand and which the vendors don’t always explain. And once you understand the theory (and can even look at the source code), you can rely on yourself to solve problems and examine and understand the results.
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Standard">
While writing this book on theory, he realized that even with an understanding of the theory, many relatively simple problems are still very complicated calculations and some software should be created based on this theory. So the book teaches the theory, but then also teaches how to use the software tools that utilize the theory. Originally all of these software tools were in the form of the SignalIntegrity library and were utilized from Python scripts.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
And finally, again during the development of this book and tools, he realized that even the scripts get too complicated and it would be good to have a GUI based application - that is PySIApp. But the development of the SignalIntegrity library first provided huge advantages - it can be tested well and can be utilized very flexibly. Currently there are about 600 tests that test for proper behavior of the underlying library. As for the GUI, these are very difficult to test in an automated manner and by definition, must be a bit less flexible.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
The goal is for this software to be released as open source software in some manner, once proper licenses get worked out. But for now, see <a class="Reference" href="PySIHelp-Section-3.html#sec:License">License↓</a>.
